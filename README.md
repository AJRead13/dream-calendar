## Description
        - This project is a dream calendar that will be used to record and track the dreams of users.  Users will be able to log their dreams through a series of prompts and save them and view them on their calendar.  During the logging process of the dreams, users will be prompted to answer questions regarding their dreams that align with accepted psychological standards.  Eventual development will lead to dream analysis through integrated AI.
